To make a more precise layout on your webpage you can use a grid!

### Create a class

Create a class inside of your `style.css` file, it is best that you use a **class** or **id** for this. If you style a tag every version of that on your page will be a grid.

Set the `display` property to `grid`.

Set a `height` - you can use `vh` for this or set a `px` value.

Define your **rows** (the `grid-template-rows` property) and **columns** (the `grid-template-columns`).

You can set the size of your rows in any of these ways:

- Percentages - you can set the rows and columns as a `%` of the width or height
- Fractions - you can set them as a `fr` of the width or height
- Pixels - you can set the height as a direct `px` value

Here are some examples:

## --- code ---

language: css
filename: style.css
---------------------------------------------------

// A class
.fact-holder {
display: grid;
height: 50vh;
grid-template-rows: 50% 50%;
grid-template-columns: 50% 50%;
}

\--- /code ---

## --- code ---

language: css
filename: style.css
---------------------------------------------------

// An ID
\#homepage-grid {
display: grid;
height: 80vh;
grid-template-rows: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}

\--- /code ---

### Add the grid to your HTML

Once you have create your selector - add your class or id to a **HTML** element.

## --- code ---

## language: html

<section class="fact-holder">

</section>

\--- /code ---

## --- code ---

## language: html

<div id="homepage-grid">

</div>

\--- /code ---
